# Personal-Hub-Project
Organization Journal / personal hub - A personal organization app with a calendar and multiple tools to make this your organized hub. Connect with other users to set up meeting times and share schedules

My mission is to create a web app you can take anywhere! Have your your **schedule, events, meetings
and more**, just a click away. Chat with freinds, connect your other apps and send documents all
in one place. This app is all you need to stay connected and organzied.

# Personal Hub Work Flow

The main components of the apps work flow is **categories and schduels** (For now, maybe). We will sort everything using this method- **for example**, we have a category of "birthdays" where we can set schedules and attach them to that category and later sort them (Sorting not yet added since it is a huge component of the site and will need to be worked on a lot).

# Bonus

The bonus I worked on that we have not yet learned in class is attaching the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) 
The Code for this is added on like **54-62** in views/shared/_Layout.cshtml

# In The Future

There is a TON of changes and updates I would like to work on in the future to better organize my life and maybe being able to help others by publishing this project. For now this is a lot of work to do and I am very excited about learning more about ASP.NET to make this website fully functional and how I imagine it! 

Here is a list of a few things I would like to add:

 - Calander
 - Chat
 - Google maps integration
 - Document Storage
 - Email updates
